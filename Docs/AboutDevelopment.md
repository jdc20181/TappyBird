#Introduction 

Tappy Bird a Flappy Bird Spin off Clone is freely available under the MIT License. 

You may obtain the latest version and use it for your own project- in the `Releases` Folder. 

Tappy Bird is going to be a advancement of Flappy Bird, and achieve goals that Flappy Bird did not. 

The Flappy Bird Sensation came to a hault due to its removal from app stores. While there are hundreds of clones out there Tappy bird will be 
the new Flappy Bird - Giving you a new sensation of annoyance! Can you reach the end? 

#New Obtacles - Levels - and new scoring mechanism. 

The new obtacles will change as the score changes - Really it doesn't change. Just in the visual context. This of course will come with time. 

These obstacles will offer a visual sensation making it harder to make it through each level. As of now - The plan is to have (3) three
new obstacles - 

Skyscrapers - Cars - and Bridges. 

These will need to be about the same size as the `pipe.png` so nothing changes but as stated the visual context.

With that in mind Tappy Bird will also offer a complex leveling system-

The new leveling system will break down into Obstacle Stages. As you climb the 4 stages of Tappy Bird be ready to fail. 

The new items in the leveling system will incude:

 - Faster rate of "Tappy-Bird" himself. 
 
 - Slower Point rate
 
    - Classic Round : X10
    
    - Skyscrapers : X5
    
    - Cars : X2 
    
    - Bridges: X1
