#Development of TappyBird

Be sure to check out the `About Development` it has some information on what is needed to be done to move the project further. 


#Developer Contributing Guide


Contributing should be done in a orderly fashion. 

When contributing Pull Requests:

 - Include What it is you are adding

 - Why it is needed

*Make sure it works first!*

And please be sure it works properly by cloning locally. 

If it adds anything in the `About Development` section please be sure to use `MarkDown` and strike through the item completed. 

`Markup :  ~~Strikethrough text~~`

If you have any issues with a PR or need help. Create a issue - Include

What it is you want to contribute - Whats its for - And why it is needed. 

*What is NOT accepted.*

  - Anything that minimizes code will be declined. 

This is simply because Minified code in the Developer View (This respo) isn't needed. Only for production. 

  - Reverses to a previous state
  
This is uncalled for and will ultimately reverse the project's progress. 

  - Anything that collects or stores user data

Includes things like cookies.

When developers add this to their sites they may or may not have a cookie disclaimer with that in mind - anything that collects or stores data will be declined. 

  - Anything seen as not needed etc.
  
I reserve the right to decline any pull requests. But I will most likely accept any except the exceptions above.
