A Re-make of the popular game called flappy bird.

#Remaking Flappy Bird

Most of the code I am using is widely available via a quick google search - But the plan is to extend and change it up creating a larger obstacle.

#Patch- Log

Patches are what will make up a entire release. These are done hourly, Daily, Weekly, monthly. The bigger the task the longer it takes. Releases will be done after the last number reaches 9 - Which in return means there could be up to 9 patches in a release. 
The first 20 Releases will come fast with small improvments. Version 0.1.0 will come after the first `9` releases - `0.0.1-0.0.9`
