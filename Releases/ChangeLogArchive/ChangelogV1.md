#Reading The Logs

To Read Each log it goes from `Bottom` to `Top` So for example `Version 1` would be at the bottom and
`Version 1.1` would be at the top. Same applies for the log as a whole. All of the `Version 1`
notes will be at the bottom and the latest archived release e.g. `Version 2` will be on the top.
